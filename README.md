#A short story of the rise, reign, and ruin of the Antinomians, Familists, and libertines that infected the churches of New-England and how they were confuted by the assembly of ministers there as also of the magistrates proceedings in court against them : together with God's strange remarkable judgements from heaven upon some of the chief fomenters of these opinions : and the lamentable death of Mrs. Hutchison : very fit for these times, here being the same errors amongst us, and acted by the same spirit : published at the instant request of sundry, by one that was an eye and ear-witness of the carriage of matters there.#

##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

1. To the Reader.

1. The PREFACE.

#####Body#####

1. A Catalogue of such Erroneous Opinions as were found to have been brought into New-England, and spread under hand there, as they were condemned by an Assembly of the Churches, at New-Town, Aug. 30. 1637.

1. Unsavoury Speeches Confuted.

    _ 1. TO say that we are justified by Faith, is an unsafe Speech, we must say, we are Iustified by Christ.

    _ 2. To evidence justification by sanctification, or graces, savours of Rome.

    _ 3. If I be holy, I am never the better accepted of God; if I be unholy, I am never the worse; this I am sure of, he that hath elected me must save me.

    _ 4. If Christ will let me sin, let him look to it, upon his honour be it.

    _ 5. Here is a great stir about graces, and looking to hearts, but give me Christ, I seek not for graces, but for Christ; I seek not for promises, but for Christ; I seek not for Sanctification, but for Christ; tell not me of meditation and duties, but tell me of Christ.

    _ 6. A living Faith, that hath living fruits, may grow from the living Law.

    _ 7. I may know I am Christ's, not because I do crucisie the lusts of the flesh, but because I do not crucifie them, but believe in Christ that crucifieth my lusts for me.

    _ 8. Peter more leaned to a Covenant of works than Paul, Paul's Doctrine was more for free-grace than Peters.

    _ 9. If Christ be my Sanctification, what need I look to any thing in myself, to evidence my Iustification?

1. The Proceedings of the General Court holden at New-Town, in the Massachusets in New-England, Octob. 2. 1637. Against Mr. Wheelwright, and other Erroneous and Seditious Persons, for their Disturbances of the Publick Peace.
